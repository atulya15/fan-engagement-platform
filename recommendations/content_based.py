==================================
Content-based fallback -- the cold-start handler. ALS (and any
collaborative method) needs interaction history to work; it has
nothing to say about a user who just signed up or a widget that just
launched. Content-based similarity needs no interaction history at
all, only item/user features, which is exactly why it's the standard
fallback for both cold-start cases.
